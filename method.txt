# fisrtly added basics like initiallzing npm, downloading body-parser and express and ejs packages 
  and making main app.js inside which required packages, make it to listen on server 3000, adn making get request forming it empty.

# as this project is made through ejs, made ejs in views folder connecting it with app.js by setting view engine to ejs 

# as list.ejs will be treated as html file, connected it with static css and index.js files in public folder and added 
  app.use(express.static("public)), for making it work, css for styles and js for purpose of static tasks like sound and eventlistners.

In post req ;

# now made a list in list.ejs for tasks, first input submiited by user is accessed from server using body parser, then that value push backed to
  the corresponding key in list.ejs which is in list, which is an array, and then redirecting to get page of home which print all elemnts in array
  one by one 

# now list is comleted and left to add css styles in list and event listners and functions of checked and deleted(display none);
# added css to the file

##* tried to put sound on submit button, but it donot worked as before playing of sound, post request redirected the req to home route
  therefore clash between app.js and index.js (sound could be heard by continuosly pressing over submit button 5 6 times)

# Now for remove button, found a code to remove the li from ul (as display none method will lead to same li adjacent contrary to css pattern)
  by getting element through id and removing the child node of its parent , now if any one click remove btn, just have to add that id to li

# found a method to remove the li 
  -firstly making all li a separate form which consists input is value of li as string , li and a submit type button to home route 
  -giving add input and all delete input two diffrent names and hiding delete input by display none
  -now in post req in app.js, putting if condition for diff between adding an removing
  -in removing sec, getting index by comparing values through looping, and removing that index from array through splice
  and the redirecting to home

# added styles to remove button and the project is complete.
